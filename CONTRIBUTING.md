# How you can help

As we surveyed the webhooks ecosystem for implementations, we started with the top ~150 we could think of, discover, and find examples for and narrowed our focus to the top 100 measured by sentiment, traffic, and interest from informal polling. We didn't include every webhook provider here but want to expand this out to be more comprehensive.

If we missed your favorite webhooks or even your companyâ€™s webhooks, please feel free to add a pull request filling in the blanks. We've listed some of the top requested webhooks below.

# Reporting Mistakes

If something changed or we go something wrong, let us know!

Ideally, submit a pull request. Alternatively, file an issue. Either way, please link to the webhook provider's docs so we can confirm.

Note: We want easily observable facts, not subjective ratings of webhooks, APIs, etc.

# Contributing a Patch

1. Fork the repository into your own account
1. Use the instructions in README.md to deploy locally
