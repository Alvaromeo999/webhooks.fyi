# Webhooks.fyi

Webhooks.fyi is a one-stop shop for information on how to build, consume, secure, maintain, and overall function with webhooks. While we've started with a heavy security focus with an eye towards future maintainability, we want to expand this into a clearing house for the best and worst practices you will see in the wild.

Our long term vision is two fold:

First, we want to continue to be THE place for people to learn how to safely consume webhooks from their favorite providers.

Second, we want to encourage providers to adopt practices that make their webhooks more reliable, secure, and easier to use.

If we're missing your favorite webhook provider, a thoughtful or useful analysis, or we've gotten something wrong, check out CONTRIBUTING.md for steps to lend a hand. Please keep contributions heavy on facts, supported by docs, and light on marketing.
